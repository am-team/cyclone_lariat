# Note:
#   Docker needs for ssh privatekey to fetch data from github
#   To do that, this script creates hardlink to privatekey
#
# WARNING
#   privatekey MUST NOT be protected by password
#   If your `id_rsa` is protected by password, you need to create new key without password (for example, `id_rsa_git`)
#   And use that key when running this script:
#     `bin/docker-init id_rsa_git`
